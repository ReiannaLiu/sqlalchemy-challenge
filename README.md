# Honolulu Climate Analysis

Congratulations on planning the long holiday vacation to beautiful Honolulu, Hawaii! To make the most of your trip, we will help you perform a climate analysis of the area. In this README, we will outline the steps to accomplish this task.

## Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data

In this section, you will use Python, SQLAlchemy, and data visualization tools to perform a basic climate analysis and explore the climate database. 

### Step 1: Connect to the Database

1. Use the SQLAlchemy `create_engine()` function to connect to your SQLite database.

2. Utilize the `SQLAlchemy automap_base()` function to reflect your tables into classes, and save references to the classes named `Station` and `Measurement`.

3. Establish a connection between Python and the database by creating a SQLAlchemy session.

**IMPORTANT**: Always remember to close your session at the end of your notebook.

### Step 2: Precipitation Analysis

1. Find the most recent date in the dataset.

2. Using that date, retrieve the previous 12 months of precipitation data (without passing the date as a variable to your query).

3. Select only the "date" and "prcp" values.

4. Load the query results into a Pandas DataFrame, explicitly setting the column names.

5. Sort the DataFrame values by "date."

6. Plot the results using the DataFrame plot method.

7. Use Pandas to print the summary statistics for the precipitation data.

### Step 3: Station Analysis

1. Design a query to calculate the total number of stations in the dataset.

2. Find the most active station(s) (the station(s) with the most rows). List the stations and observation counts in descending order. Identify the station ID with the greatest number of observations.

3. Design a query to calculate the lowest, highest, and average temperatures, filtering on the most active station ID found in the previous query. Use functions like `func.min`, `func.max`, and `func.avg` in your query.

4. Design a query to get the previous 12 months of temperature observation (TOBS) data. Filter by the station with the most observations and plot the results as a histogram with bins=12.

5. Close your session.

## Part 2: Design Your Climate App

Having completed your initial analysis, you will now design a Flask API based on the queries developed in Part 1. The following routes should be created:

- `/`: Start at the homepage, listing all available routes.
- `/api/v1.0/precipitation`: Retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data as a JSON dictionary.
- `/api/v1.0/stations`: Return a JSON list of stations from the dataset.
- `/api/v1.0/tobs`: Query temperature observations of the most active station for the previous year and return them as a JSON list.
- `/api/v1.0/<start>` and `/api/v1.0/<start>/<end>`: Calculate TMIN, TAVG, and TMAX for a specified start or start-end range, returning the results as a JSON list.

**Hints:**
- For some queries, you may need to join the `station` and `measurement` tables.
- Use Flask's `jsonify` function to convert API data to valid JSON responses.

Enjoy your trip to Honolulu and the insights gained from your climate analysis!
